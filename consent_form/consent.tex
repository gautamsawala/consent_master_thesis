{\Huge \bf Consent Form}
\end{center}

\paragraph{}
{\large \bf Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
  \item You will be asked to watch selected short movies while your physiological data, electrocardiogram (ECG) and electrodermal activity (EDA) is recorded.
  \item All the data collected will be pseudonymous and will strictly be used for research only.
  \item We ask you to read this consent form and ask any questions you may have before agreeing to be part of the study.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}
{\large \bf Purpose of Study}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The purpose of the study is to investigate the psycho-physiological effects of watching audio visual content to predict which movie is watched.
    \item This research will be part of the master thesis and may be presented in other scientific publication.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}
{\large \bf Description of Study Procedure}
\begin{itemize}
    \item You will be asked to wear three AgCl adhesive electrodes, one electrode each under the left and right side of the collar bone and one on right side under the rib cage.
    \item In addition you will be asked to wear two non-adhesive strips, one each on your index and middle finger of the non-dominant hand.
    \item These electrodes will be hooked up to ECG and EDA sensors attached to a device which collects the data.
    \item You will first be asked to relax, and your resting physiological data will be collected for span of 60 seconds.
    \item You will then watch 3-4 short movies spanning 4-10 minutes with a break of 2-3 minutes between each movie. You can fill in the questioner during the break. The study will span approximately 45-50 minutes.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}
{\large \bf Risk/ Discomforts of being part of this study}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The short movies might have some scary and action scenes which might create discomfort.
    \item The adhesive electrodes might create some discomfort. Please mention about the same on the last page of the questioner you will be provided.
    \item There are reasonably no foreseeable risks. There may be unknown risk.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{}
{\large \bf Confidentiality}
